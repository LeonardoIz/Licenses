# Licenses
All the software licenses I use in my projects!

* **Proprietary Software License:**
  Grants the Licensee a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use the Software for internal purposes. The Creator may release updates that require acceptance of new terms. Commercial use requires reporting to the Creator. Paid licenses can be transferred under specific conditions. The Software may collect usage data, which can be deleted upon request. The Software remains the Creator's intellectual property, provided "as is" without warranties. The Creator is not liable for any damages arising from the Software's use. The Agreement is governed by the Creator's local laws, and any disputes fall under their jurisdiction. Termination occurs if the Licensee breaches the Agreement.
